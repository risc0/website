# The RISC Zero Proof System

*RISC Zero offers a computational `receipt` for any code that runs within the RISC Zero ZKVM, which serves to verifiably link the code that ran to the asserted output. RISC Zero's receipts are built on the shoulders of several recent advances in the world of Zero-Knowledge Cryptography: [zk-STARKs](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/046.pdf), [PLONK](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/953.pdf), and [DEEP-ALI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.12243.pdf).*

*In this document, we present a succinct introduction to the RISC Zero Proof system, including a sequence diagram and a step-by-step description of the RISC Zero Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge. We encourage readers to follow along with the [Fibonacci Trace Example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Onr41OozD62y-B0jIL7bHAH5kf771-o4xvmnHUFpOyo/edit?usp=sharing) for a more concrete description of the protocol.*

*To invite collaboration and open source development, this is an early-release of documentation-in-progress. The implementation in code can be seen [here](https://github.com/risc0/risc0/blob/v0.7.2/risc0/zkp/prove/prove.cpp).

## The RISC Zero Proof System: A Step-By-Step Description

### The Structure of the Execution Trace
- The Prover runs a computation in order to generate an `Execution Trace`. 
  - The `trace` is organized into `columns,` and the columns are categorized as `control columns`, `data columns`, and `PLONK columns`.
    - The `control columns` handle system initialization and shutdown, the initial program code to load into memory before execution, and other control signals that don't depend on the program execution.
    - The `data columns` contain the input and the computation data, both of which are private. These columns are committed in two orderings: 
      - in order of program execution, and 
      - re-ordered by register first and clock cycle second. The re-ordered columns allow for efficient validation of RISC-V memory operations.
    - The `PLONK columns` are used to show the validity that the re-ordered data columns are a valid permutation of the original data, as per the PLONK permutation argument. 
  - After computing the `data columns` and `PLONK columns,` the Prover adds some random `noise` to the end of those columns in order to ensure that the protocol is zero-knowledge.
- The Prover encodes the `trace` as follows:  
  - The Prover converts each `column` into a polynomial using an `iNTT`. We'll refer to these as `Trace Polynomials`, denoted $P_i(x)$.
  - The Prover evaluates the `data polynomials` and the `control polynomials` over an expanded domain and commits the evaluations into two separate Merkle Trees.
  - Using these Merkle roots as an entropy-source, we use Fiat-Shamir to choose `PLONK mixing parameters,` using a SHA-2 CRNG.
  - Then, the Prover uses the `PLONK mixing parameters` to generate the `PLONK columns`, interpolates them to form the `PLONK polynomials,` evaluates those polynomials over a larger domain, and commits those evaluations to a Merkle tree (see the [PLONK paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/953.pdf) for details). 
  - The Prover sends the Merkle root of each tree to the Verifier.
  - Using these three Merkle roots as an entropy-source, we use Fiat-Shamir to choose a `constraint mixing parameter` $\alpha$, using a SHA-2 CRNG.
### Validity Polynomials: The Core of the STARK Proof
- The Prover uses the `constraint mixing parameter`, the `Trace Polynomials`, and the `Rule Checking Polynomials` to construct a few `Low Degree Validity Polynomials.` The details are as follows:
  - By writing $k$ publicly known `Rule Checking Polynomials`,  $R_0, R_1, ..., R_{k-1}$, in terms of the private `Trace Polynomials`, the Prover generates $k$ `Constraint Polynomials`, $C_j(x)$. 
    - The key point about these polynomials is that for each of the $k$ rules and each input $z$ that's associated with the trace, $C_j(z)$ will return 0 if the trace "passes the test," so to speak. 
  - Using the `constraint mixing parameter` $\alpha$, the Prover combines the `Constraint Polynomials`, $C_j$ into a single `Mixed Constraint Polynomial`, $C$, by computing $C(x)=\alpha^0C_0(x)+\ldots+\alpha^{k-1}C_{k-1}(x).$ 
    - Note that if each $C_j$ returns 0 at some point $z$, then $C$ will also return 0 at $z$. 
  - Using a publicly known `Zeros Polynomial`, the Prover computes the `High Degree Validity Polynomial`, $V(x)=\frac{C(x)}{Z(x)}$.
    - The `Zeros Polynomial` $Z(x)$ is a divisor of any honest construction of $C(x)$. In other words, an honest prover will construct $V(x)$ to be a polynomial of lower degree than $C(x)$. We call $V$ "high degree" relative to the Trace Polynomials, $P_i$.
  - The Prover `splits` the `High Degree Validity Polynomial` into 4 `Low Degree Validity Polynomials`, $v_0(x), v_1(x), ..., v_3$. 
  
  - The Prover evaluates the `Low Degree Validity Polynomials`, encodes them in a Merkle Tree, and sends the Merkle root to the Verifier. 
  
  - We use Fiat-Shamir to choose the `DEEP Test Point`, $z$. 
### The DEEP Technique
- The Verifier would like to check the asserted relation between $C$, $Z$, and $V$ at the `DEEP Test Point,` $z$. Namely, the Verifier would like to confirm that $V(z)Z(z)=C(z)$.
  - The Prover sends the evaluations of each $v_i$ at $z$, which allows the Verifier to compute $V(z)$. 
  - Computing $C(z)$ is slightly more complicated. Because `rule checks` can check relationships across multiple `columns` and multiple `clock cycles`,  evaluating $C(z)$ requires numerous evaluations of the form $P_i(\omega^nz)$ for varying `columns` $i$ and `cycles` $n$. The Prover sends these `necessary evaluations` of each $P_i$ to allow the Verifier to evaluate $C(z)$. We refer to the `necessary evaluations` $P_i(\omega^nz)$ as the `taps` of $P_i$ at $z$. 
  - The Verifier can now check $V(z)Z(z)=C(z)$. 
  - Although these asserted evaluations have no associated Merkle branches, the DEEP technique offers an alternative to the usual Merkle proof.
- The Prover constructs the DEEP polynomials using the `taps`:
  - Denoting the `taps` of $P_i$ at $z$ as $(x_1,P_i(x_1)),\ldots,(x_n,P_i(x_n))$, the Prover constructs the DEEP polynomial $P'_i(x)=\frac{P_i(x)-\overline{P_i}(x)}{(x-x_1)\ldots(x-x_n)}$ where $\overline{P_i}(x)$ is the polynomial formed by interpolating the taps of $P_i$. The Prover computes $P'_i$, runs an iNTT on the result, and sends the coefficients of $P'_i$ to the Verifier. Using this technique, the Prover constructs and sends a DEEP polynomial for each $P_i$ and each $v_i$. 
- At this point, the claim of trace validity has been reduced to the claim that each of the DEEP polynomials is actually a low-degree polynomial. To conclude the proof, the Prover mixes the DEEP polynomials into the `FRI Polynomial` using a `DEEP mixing parameter` and use the FRI protocol to show that the `FRI Polynomial` is a low-degree polynomial.
