# Getting Started

To get started working with RISC Zero projects, take a look at these GitHub repositories:

* [**Hello World in Rust**](https://github.com/risc0/risc0-rust-starter) - Our starter project for the RISC Zero zkVM. If you're just getting started writing code for the zkVM, we recommend reading (and playing with) this repository.

* [**RISC Zero Battleship**](https://github.com/risc0/battleship-example) - To see a more complex use of the RISC Zero zkVM in action, take a look at this working Battleship game. Here, players use private game board states to track whether opponents have sunk their battleships.

* [**Rust crates**](https://github.com/risc0/risc0#rust-crates) - If you're a Rust user, you'll find RISC Zero crates here, ready to be included in your existing projects.

* [**Contribute to RISC Zero**](http://www.github.com/risc0/risc0) - If you're interested in how RISC Zero projects for the zkVM work, or curious about contributing to this project, come take a look at our main project repository.
